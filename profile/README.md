# 🛡️ NetKnights Club

Welcome to **NetKnights**, a community-driven cybersecurity club for curious minds, digital defenders, and chaotic-good hackers in the making. Whether you're interested in red teaming, blue teaming, ethical hacking, Linux wizardry, or just want to learn how the internet *actually* works — you're in the right place.

> "Protect the net. Educate the future. Knight the nerds."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **We're Not *That* NetKnights**  
> This organization is in no way affiliated with [NetKnights GmbH](https://netknights.it/en/), the German IT security company.  
> We are a community-driven, youth-led cybersecurity club hosted at a public library.  
> Our activities include learning ethical hacking, hosting mini CTFs, geeking out about Linux,  
> and occasionally yelling at broken scripts.  
>  
> If you're looking for professional services... uh, not us. But if you want to learn, tinker, or cause  
> harmless chaos in virtual machines — welcome aboard!

## ⚔️ About Us

NetKnights is a grassroots cyber club that runs out of a **library**, not a classroom. We believe in:
- 💻 Open knowledge
- 🔒 Cybersecurity awareness
- 🧠 Skill-sharing, mentorship, and growth
- ☕ Chill vibes, cool hacks, and ethical exploration

We're the folks who:
- Break stuff in a VM *on purpose*
- Use Arch btw
- Actually know what DNS is
- And *maybe* sniff the school Wi-Fi for fun (👀 ...in lab environments only, of course.)

## 🌐 Projects

We're working on:
- A static **club website** (hosted on GitHub Pages)
- Learning resources (guides, cheatsheets, beginner challenges)
- Private tools (CTF setups, scripting examples, detection evasion basics)
- Event ideas (Cyber Nights™, LAN parties)

More coming soon — or whenever we stop procrastinating.
